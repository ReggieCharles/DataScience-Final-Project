# DataScience-Final-Project
This project explored the effectiveness of three forecasting models—ARIMA, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—for predicting the S&P 500 index. The objective was to assess and compare the three models in terms of their accuracy and reliability in forecasting market trends. I employed historical S&P 500 data to implement and evaluate each model, using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) to gauge their performance. Through the analysis, I found that the LSTM model outperformed both the CNN and ARIMA models, thus achieving the lowest MAE and MSE as well as the highest R² value. I attribute the LSTM model’s superior performance to its capacity for learning long-term dependencies and capturing complex temporal patterns present in the financial data. I believe that LSTM models offer significant advantages for improving prediction accuracy and providing valuable insights for investors and analysts. For future research, I recommend exploring hybrid models and incorporating additional data sources to enhance forecasting reliability and robustness.
The data was imported, cleaned, and processed.
each model was built,trained and data fed into the models
exploratory data analysis
results were obtained.
